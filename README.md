# 3D-Game-Data-Parameter-Problem-Solution
 Assume you have a client with an in-browser 3D Trading Card Game, where each character/card is a unique and ungradable NFT Demo link: https://play.card.casa/ (Note: Link is still work in progress) You need to make a list of all the data points you would collect for this project from the browser activity/events and also make a flow-chart of all the possible AI/ML models you would use to obtain some insights from the data you suggested collecting. The goal of the AI/ML models will be to determine what is causing low/high retention in the players playing the game.
